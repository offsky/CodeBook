<p>The Keyword cipher is identical to the Caesar Cipher with the exception that the substitution alphabet used can be represented with a keyword.</p>

<p>To create a substitution alphabet from a keyword, you first write down the alphabet. Below this you write down the keyword (omitting duplicate letters) followed by the remaining unused letters of the alphabet.</p>

<pre>
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
KEYWORDABCFGHIJLMNPQSTUVXZ
</pre>

<p>To encipher a plaintext message, you convert all letters from the top row to their correspondng letter on the bottom row (A to K, B to E, etc).</p>

<p>These types of simple substitution ciphers can be easily cracked by using frequency analysis and some educated guessing.</p>
