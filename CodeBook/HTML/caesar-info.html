<p>A Caesar cipher is one of the simplest (and easiest cracked) encryption methods.  It is a Substitution Cipher that involves replacing each letter of the secret message with a different letter of the alphabet which is a fixed number of positions further in the alphabet.</p>

<p>Because each letter in the message has a direct translation to another letter, frequency analysis can be used to decipher the message.  For example, the letter E is the most commonly used letter in the English language. Thus, if the most common letter in a secret message is K, it is likely that K represents E.  Additionally, common word endings such as ING, LY, and ES also give clues.</p>

<p>A brute-force approach of trying all 25 possible combinations would also work to decipher the message.</p>

<b>Example</b><br />
<p>In this example, each letter in the plaintext message has been shifted 3 letters down in the alphabet.</p>

Plaintext: This is a secret message<br />
Ciphertext: wklv lv d vhfuhw phvvdjh<br />
