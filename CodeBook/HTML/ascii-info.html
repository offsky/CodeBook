<p>ASCII is a code used by computers to represent characters as numbers. This allows computers to store a letter as one byte of information.  One byte of information allows you to represent 256 different values, which is enough to encode all the letters (uppercase and lowercase) as well as the numbers 0-9 and other special characters such as the @ symbol.</p>
