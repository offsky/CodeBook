<p>Morse code is a method for transmitting information, using standardized sequences of short and long marks or pulses - commonly known as "dots" and "dashes" - for the letters, numerals, punctuation and special characters of a message.</p>

<p>Originally created for Samuel Morse's electric telegraph in the mid-1830s, it was also extensively used for early radio communication beginning in the 1890s. However, with the development of more advanced communications technologies, the widespread use of Morse code is now largely obsolete.</p>
 
<p>When using morse code, the timing is as follows: A dash is equal to three dots.  A space between parts of the same letter is equal to one dot.  A space between two letters is equal to three dots and a space between two words is equal to five dots.</p>
